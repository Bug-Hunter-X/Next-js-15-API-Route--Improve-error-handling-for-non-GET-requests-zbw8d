# Next.js 15 API Route: Improved Error Handling for Non-GET Requests

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 API routes and provides a solution for improved error handling. The original code provides a basic 405 (Method Not Allowed) response for non-GET requests.  The improved version provides more context for debugging and client-side handling.

## Problem

The original `pages/api/users.js` file handles GET requests correctly but only returns a generic 405 status code for other HTTP methods. This can be challenging to debug in production or when building client applications that need specific error messages.

## Solution

The updated `pages/api/usersSolution.js` file provides a more informative response for non-GET requests, indicating the allowed method.  It could also include additional details like specific error messages depending on your requirements.

## Usage

Clone this repository and run `npm install`. Then, you can test the original and improved API routes using a tool like curl or Postman.
